### Data Science & Ecology

[Predicting and Modeling Insect Phenology](https://github.com/icaruso21/Insect-Phenology-Forecaster)
Created as part of [The Trench Project](https://github.com/trenchproject) at University of Washington, this interactive R-Shiny based insect phenology forecaster provides a detailed picture of the current developmental status of various insect species across the US and also attempts to predict development using daily weather data. This educational visualization provides educators with tools to clearly and concisely teach critical ecological principles to aspiring functional ecologists. This project is currently hosted on an AWS EC2 instance and is using automated scheduling to update insect phenology from daily geospatial data.

[Ring of Fire: Evolving a Wildfire Simulator using Genetic Programming](https://github.com/Oliver-BE/ring-of-fire)
A parallelized genetic program for evolving rules that describe a cellular automaton based wildfire simulation. Both the genetic program and the wildfire simulator were written in Clojure by [@Oliver-BE](https://github.com/Oliver-BE), [@MGlusker](https://github.com/MGlusker), and myself.

### Assorted Projects 

[Intellage: An Intelligent Photo Collage Creator](https://github.com/icaruso21/intellage)
Written in Java by [@Oliver-BE](https://github.com/Oliver-BE) and myself, this program aims to recreate an input photo from a user-specified collection of jpg images. The following examples each utilized a collection of 26,000 stock images:

[Youtube Watch Later](https://github.com/icaruso21/Youtube-Watch-Later)
This project leveraged Vagrant's support for the VirtualBox hypervisor to automate the deployment of two intercommunicating EC2 instances hosting webservers and updating/querying a MySQL database via REST APIs as part of a project for a Cloud Computing Architecture course.
